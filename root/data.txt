A recent study done in the BS university has come to a conclusion that using the eStudent application will
          increase your productivity by 28.2%, making it the best modern tool for students. If cramming all of your
          study time into a few long days isn’t working for you then it’s time to try something new and less stressful.
          What you do every day is more important than what you do occasionally, so make time for studying every single
          day, with or without exams coming up. Let it be a routine, using eStudent while studying.
